<h3>Coughing</h3>
Coughing- Expel air from the lungs with a sudden sharp sound.
<p>A cough is a common reflex action that clears the throat of mucus or foreign irritants. Coughing to clear the throat is typically an infrequent action, although there are a number of conditions that can cause more frequent bouts of coughing.

In general, a cough that lasts for less than three weeks is an acute cough.

A cough that lasts between three and eight weeks, improving by the end of that period, is a subacute cough.

A persistent cough that lasts more than eight weeks is a chronic cough.

Most cough episodes will clear up, or at least significantly improve, within two weeks. If you cough up blood or have a “barking” cough, talk to your doctor. Any cough that hasn’t improved after a few weeks may be serious and you should see a doctor.

<h4 style="text-align:left"> Home Remedies</h4>
<ul>

<li>Honey - it coats the throat, resulting in less irritation and possibly less coughing. Honey is a demulcent (something that soothes).</li>
<li>Cough medications - some may help associated symptoms, such as fever or a stuffy nose. However, there is no compelling evidence that cough medicines are effective in making the cough go away faster.</li>
For small children, it is a good idea to talk to a doctor before giving OTC cough medicine. Some ingredients in cough medicines can be dangerous for small children.
<li>Cough suppressants - these suppress the cough reflex and are generally only prescribed for a dry cough. Examples include pholcodine, dextromethorphan, and antihistamines.</li>
<li>Expectorants - these help bring up mucus and other material from the trachea, bronchi, and lungs. An example is guaifenesin (guaiphenesin), which thins the mucus and also lubricates the irritated respiratory tract, helping to drain the airways.</li>
